# Implementation Plan: Go Version Upgrade & Unit Testing

## Completed Tasks

### Dependency Modernization
- Migrated from dep/Gopkg to Go modules
  - Created go.mod with proper module path
  - Added replace directive for `github.com/imdario/mergo => dario.cat/mergo`
  - Removed Gopkg.toml and Gopkg.lock
- Updated dependencies to compatible versions
- Updated Makefile with Go modules support

### Code Quality & Testing
- Added basic unit tests with proper mocking
- Fixed all linting issues:
  - Error handling: Wrapped all errors from external packages with proper context
  - Code style: Added package comments, function documentation, and constants
  - Clean code: Removed unused variables, renamed unused parameters
  - Formatting: Fixed long lines and improved readability

### Build Infrastructure
- Enhanced bootstrap process for dependency management
- Added lint targets to Makefile for quality checks
- Added test target for running unit tests

## Remaining Tasks

### Code Migration
- Update any deprecated Go language features
- Update code to use newer dependency APIs
- Fix any breaking changes in the dependencies

### Testing
- Add tests for fetchReleases and fetchIndices functions
- Add tests for other formatting outputs (plain, yaml, table)
- Implement integration tests if needed
- Add GitHub Actions or other CI/CD workflow for automated testing

### Documentation & Finalization
- Update version information in plugin.yaml
- Create release notes for the upgrade

### Release
- Create a new release with updated binary artifacts
- Test the plugin with the latest Helm version
- Update the plugin in the Helm plugin repository (if applicable)

## Development Workflow

### Quality Checks
```bash
# Run after each code change to verify tests pass
make test

# Run linter to ensure code quality before committing
make lint

# Run a specific linter only
make lint-specific LINTER=wrapcheck
```

### Build Process
```bash
# Rebuild the binary after changes
make build

# Build for all supported platforms
make dist
```

Clone existing upstream issues so I can fix them:

```python
from github import Github
import os

# Authentication - use a Personal Access Token
g = Github(os.environ.get("GITHUB_TOKEN"))

# Source and target repositories
source_repo = g.get_repo("original-owner/original-repo")
target_repo = g.get_repo("your-username/your-fork")

# Get all issues from source repo
source_issues = source_repo.get_issues(state="all")

# Clone each issue to the target repo
for issue in source_issues:
    body = f"""
Original issue: {issue.html_url}

{issue.body}
"""
    new_issue = target_repo.create_issue(
        title=f"[UPSTREAM] {issue.title}",
        body=body,
        labels=[label.name for label in issue.labels]
    )
    print(f"Created issue #{new_issue.number} from upstream #{issue.number}")
```
